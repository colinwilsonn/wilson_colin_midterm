    <h2> The best hangover food </h2>
<p> An amazing hangover food pizza with pineapple is absolutely delicious, In a world where thereâ€™s all sorts of different fast food options I find myself reaching for a classic pineapple pizza the most.</p>
 
   <h3> the woke slice </h3> 
<p> Thanks to the sweet flavour pineapple adds a layer of delicious sweetness to the otherwise kinda bland taste of classic pizza, additionally to the boost in flavour pineapple adds a fun texture to each bite with the bursting of each pineapple piece
    making eating a pineapple pizza a more dynamic activity that takes you to flavour heaven after a long night out.</p> 


    <h3> the pinneapple solution </h3>
<p>In conclusion pineapple definitely belongs on pizza if not only because of its delicious flavour contributions 
    then because of its textural contributions which work in tandem to turn any boring dull slice of basic pizza into a fun sweet and salty slice of heaven. </p>
