                <p>Created in the southern Italian town of Gaeta in 997 AD, pizza has become a global staple for comfort food and represents the culinary genius of Italy. Classic Italian pizza holds hundreds of years of tradition, culture, and deliciousness in every bite.</p>
                
                <h3>The Classic Pizza</h3>
                <p>The classic simplicity of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, a drizzle of olive oil, and basil leaves a tantalizing taste that transports you to a warm sunny day in the streets of Italy, filling both your heart and stomach with joy.</p>
                
                <h3>The Modern Threat</h3>
                <p>However, pizza's classic beauty has come under attack in modern times, with the addition of ingredients like pineapple by uncultured individuals threatening the delicious sanctity of pizza.</p>
                
                <h3>The Pineapple Problem</h3>
                <p>Being the most common new addition to pizza nowadays, pineapple creates:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li>A disgustingly warm, soggy mess atop the defenseless slice</li>
                    <li>A textural assault on the palate</li>
                    <li>A sweetness that completely contradicts the natural acidity of the tomato sauce</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Due to both its textural and flavor effects, pineapple simply does not belong on pizza. At most, the addition of pineapple should be seen as an attack on one of Italy's cultural crown jewels.</p>
